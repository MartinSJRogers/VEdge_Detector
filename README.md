## A tool for automatic coastal vegetation edge detection

VEdge_Detector is a python-based tool for the automated detection of coastal vegetation edges in remote sensing imagery. The tool produces a heatmap, showing the pixels predicted with the highest confidence as being the vegetation line. The images below show the outputs produced by the VEdge_Detector tool in A) Suffolk, United Kingdom; B) Wilk auf FÃ¶hr, Germany and C) Varela, Guinea Bissau.
